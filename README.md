A project on Texas motor vehicle crash reports in 2021 from 1/2/2021 to 10/28/2021
Will be using the data to determine the areas with the most crashes.
Need to review the data for more questions to ask.
Data is from the TxDOT Public Crash Interface Data.
There are total of 6034333 missing values in the entire dataframe.
Need to remove columns not needed to clean up missing values.
